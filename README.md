A sample E-commerce website for my portfolio.

This application uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

An integration with [Stripe](http://stripe.com/) is implemented with this website to make purchases.

This website is also deployed to production using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
